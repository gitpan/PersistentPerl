This is not built by default.  Use the Makefile.PL here to build
perperl.ph.  Then use perperl_dump.pl to dump out the contents of the
perperl temp file.

The missing_slots script will check for any missing slots in the output
from perperl_dump.pl

struct_sizes.pl shows the sizes of the slot structs
